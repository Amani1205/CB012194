            <p>Sea turtles are magnificent animals that have lived in the oceans for millions of years, but they are in danger of dying out due to a variety of factors. In their natural environments, these extraordinary reptiles, known for their grace and toughness, face a variety of difficulties. The threats to turtles are numerous and varied, ranging from illegal trade and pollution to habitat loss and bycatching.These threats maybe due to natural reasons and as well as man made reasons. Understanding and addressing these threats is essential to ensure the survival of these cherished and long-lived creatures.</p>

            <h5>What is bycatch?</h5>
            <p>Bycatch is the term used to describe non-target species that are unintentionally caught in fishing equipment while being targeted as a different species. It happens when fishermen unintentionally catch and harm other marine animals, such as sea turtles,while pursuing some specific species.
            </p>
            
            
        </div>

        <div class="thr-par">
            <h5>Consequences of bycatch</h5>
            <p>The turtles that become victims of bycatch often suffer injuries and even die, such threat influences on the turtle population as it disrupts its lifecycle, and also turtles may become weaker and more vulnerable to predators or other threats as a result of the stress and trauma they experience during the capture process.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="thr-par">
            <h5>How to prevent bycatch?</h5>
           <ol>
            <li>Selecting a proper fishing gear</li>
            <li>Implementing time and area closures</li>
            <li>Following improved fishing practices</li>
            <li>Developing specialized bycatch reduction devices</li>
           </ol>

        <div class="thr-par">
            <h5>What is pollution?</h5>
            <p>Sea turtles can mistake floating plastic materials for jellyfish and can choke on them when they try to eat them. These encounters are often fatal. Lost or discarded fishing gear—called ghost gear—entangles sea turtles and can drown or render a turtle unable to feed or swim. Trash on beaches can trap hatchlings and prevent them from reaching the ocean. Oil spills also poison sea turtles of all ages.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="thr-par">
            <h5>Consequences of pollution</h5>
            <p>Marine debris, especially plastic, is frequently mistaken for food by turtles. They might consume floating debris in the water, such as plastic bags, bottles, fishing lines, and other things. Ingested debris can result in internal injuries, digestive system obstructions, and malnutrition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="thr-par">
            <h5>How to prevent pollution?</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Participating in beach cleanups</li>
                <li>Avoiding the usage of single use plastics</li>
                <li>Practicing proper waste disposal and recycling practices </li>
                <li>Avoid using chemical based products that might contaminate waterways</li>

            <h5>What is Overharvesting and illegal trade?</h5>
            <p>Sea turtles continue to be harvested unsustainably both for human consumption and trade of their parts. Turtle meat and eggs are a source of food and income for many people around the world. Some also kill turtles for medicine and religious ceremonies.Killing of turtles for both domestic and international markets continues as well. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="thr-par">
            <h5>Consequences of Overharvesting and illegal trade</h5>
            <p>Overharvesting and illegal trade in turtles can cause significant population declines and, in some cases, accelerate the extinction of species. Large-scale removals from the wild interfere with the ecosystems' natural balance and make it more difficult for turtle populations to grow and recover.</p>

            <h5>How to prevent illegal trade?</h5>

                <li>Monitoring and imposing laws to detect and combat illegal trade activities </li>

            <p> Sea turtles are dependent on beaches for nesting. Uncontrolled coastal development, vehicle traffic on beaches, and other human activities have directly destroyed or disturbed sea turtle nesting beaches around the world</p>

        <div class="thr-par">
            <h5>Consequences of Habitat loss</h5>
