            <h3>Green sea turtle</h3>
            <div class="wrap-par">
            <p>The Green turtle (Chelonia mydas), one of the biggest marine turtles ever recorded, is the one that is most frequently spotted in Sri Lanka. It may be identified by its flattened body, which is encased in a tear-shaped shell that is blackish grey in color, a smaller head than the loggerhead turtle, and a pair of enormous flippers that resemble paddles. The average adult turtle weighs between 68 and 190 kg, however rare species can reach weights of 315 kg.</p>
            <p>Its name comes from the green-colored fat that is found in the layers beneath its shell. They are mostly found thriving in tropical ocean waters, where they solely consume marine plants like algae and sea grass before returning to the beach to deposit their eggs.</p>

                <p>Similar to other sea turtles, green turtles are known to cover enormous distances over the course of their lifetimes. From feeding grounds to nesting beaches in the tropics and subtropics, some individuals may travel across entire ocean basins. During their migrations, green turtles use the earth's magnetic field as an invisible map. Like other female marine turtles, green turtles come back to the beach where they were hatched to lay their eggs</p>

            <h3>Hawksbill Sea turtle</h3>
            <div class="wrap-par">
            <p>The Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a marine turtle that is listed as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union as a result of poachers seeking its beautiful tortoise-shell, which is commercially valuable, human consumption of tortoise flesh & eggs in addition to the reptile getting wedged in fishing gear.</p>
             <p>In appearance it is dark golden brown in colour with reddish orange streaks, its most distinctive feature being the thick scutes that make up its hard upper shell. The Hawksbill turtle is relatively small to medium in size with an elongated head that tapers into a pointed hawk-like beak. Its habitat is mainly coral reefs and shallow lagoons where it feeds on sponges, fish, sea anemones and jellyfish amongst others.</p>
            <details>
                <Summary>Read more</Summary>
                <p>Hawksbill turtles, like many other marine turtle species, spend the majority of their time in the water; females only come ashore to lay eggs. Even when that beach is far from their feeding grounds, female hawksbill turtles return there to lay their eggs. Hawksbill turtles nest all over their range, frequently in areas with only a few other nesting adults, unlike many other sea turtle species. Along with thousands of other adults, other sea turtle species frequently return to a relatively small number of nesting sites.</p>

            <h3>Loggerhead sea turtle</h3>
            <div class="wrap-par">
            <p>The loggerhead turtle gets its name from the size of its head, which houses strong jaw muscles that let it to eat hard-shelled prey like whelks and conch.</p>
            <p>The females of these marine reptiles briefly come ashore to lay their eggs in bays, lagoons, and salt marshes, although they are primarily found in salt water, often hundreds of kilometres out at sea. Being carnivores, they mostly eat marine invertebrates, particularly crabs with hard shells, which they eat with their mighty jaws. The lifespan of a loggerhead sea turtle is estimated to be 50 years.</p>

                <p>A loggerhead turtle may travel to and from preferred feeding or nesting sites several times over the course of its lifetime. Even though it is thousands of miles away from their preferred feeding grounds, loggerhead turtles, like other marine turtles, return to the same beach where they hatched to lay their eggs. </p>

            <h3>Olive Ridley Sea Turtle</h3>
            <div class="wrap-par">
            <p>Olive Ridley The Lepidochelys olivacea sea turtle is a species that lives in the warm Indian Ocean seas. It is a relatively little creature with an upper exoskeleton in the form of a black heart that matures to an olive green color. It weighs little more than 50 kilograms and measures 60 to 70 centimeters on average in length. The Olive Ridley sea turtle, noted for being the one that is most frequently encountered, is known for arriving on land in huge groups at once known as "arribada" in order to lay their eggs. The Olive Ridley has a lifespan of 50 years and mostly consumes jellyfish, shrimp, mollusks, and fish.</p>
            <details>
                <Summary>Read more</Summary>
                <p>There are at least 80 countries with coastlines where olive ridley turtles can be found. Typically, it is unknown for olive ridley turtles to travel between or among ocean basins.Although their exact age has not yet been established, olive ridley turtles are thought to live long lives similar to other sea turtles. Due to their long lifespan, olive ridley turtles do not reach sexual maturity until they are 13 years old, making them susceptible to population declines caused by natural causes.</p>

            <h3>Leatherback Sea Turtle</h3>
            <div class="wrap-par">
            <p>The Leatherback Sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is regarded as the fourth-heaviest modern reptile and the largest living turtle. It may be identified by its big, teardrop-shaped body that is a massive shade of grayish-black and is coated in skin and greasy flesh, as well as by the seven distinct ridges that run along its body from front to back.</p>
            <p> The leatherback sea turtle can reach heights of up to seven feet (two meters) and can weigh over two thousand pounds (900 kilograms). It can swim swiftly through the water thanks to its hydrodynamic body structure and a sizable pair of front flippers because it primarily feeds on jellyfish and other small marine invertebrates.</p>
            <details>
                <Summary>Read more</Summary>
                <p>While leatherback  turtles are known to eat some plant material and other food, their preferred prey, by far, are jellyfishes and other gelatinous animals. They have specialized spikes in their mouths and throat to ensnare this prey and ensure that it does not escape after the turtle bites it.
                    Due to a variety of special adaptations that enable them to generate and retain body heat, such as their large body size, a thick layer of fat, and altering their swimming activity, leatherback turtles, unlike many other reptile species, are able to maintain warm body temperatures in cold water.
