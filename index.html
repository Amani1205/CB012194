        <h3>What is a turtle hatchery?</h3>

            <p>A turtle hatchery is a specialized establishment that works to protect and conserve sea turtles by ensuring the survival of the hatchlings and creating a secure environment for the eggs to hatch in. These hatcheries are essential in reducing the dangers that turtles face during the delicate phases of their life cycles.</p>
            <p>The main activity of a turtle hatchery is to collect the eggs which are laid by turtles on the beach and reloacate them safely in their hatchery, this is done in order to safeguard the eggs from human activities, predation or damages until they are hatched.
            Hatcheries keep a close eye on the incubation process and maintain ideal humidity and temperature levels to support a healthy embryonic development. The hatchery staff carefully excavates the nests to prevent any harm to the emerging turtles when it is time for the hatchlings to emerge from their eggs. To increase their chances of surviving, the young turtles are then released into the ocean under the supervision of trained staff.

                <li>Turtles help control their prey- For example, leatherbacks help manage the amount jellyfish in the ocean, and hawksbills help reefs by eating sponges that compete with them for space. </li>
                <li>Green turtles grazing on seagrass is an important way to keep seagrass beds healthy. Healthy seagrass benefits many species and stores carbon.</li>
                <li>They are important for coastal economies and native communities. Many places rely on turtle watching or diving for jobs and income and a number of indigenous communities revere sea turtles as part of their cultures. Plus there are emotional and psychological benefits to seeing a sea turtle in the wild. </li>

        <h3>Role of Sri Lankan government in protecting turtles</h3>

            <p>Conservation volunteering is a great way of gaining knowledge and learning, discovering a new country, and getting to know a new culture, whilst doing your bit to save the environment at the same time. Sri Lanka has several nesting beaches for sea turtles and unfortunately poaching from humans, predators and dogs can be a common occurance if unsupervised. In addition with increased tourism and fishing activities turtles also get caught in fishing nets and get injured. To safeguard against this and to provide care for the well-being of sea turtles, the Sri Lankan government have authorised several turtle hatcheries along the country's western and southern coastline.</p>
            <p>To protect sea turtles, Sri Lanka passed legislation. Sea turtles and other marine life are protected under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act as well as the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. These laws make it illegal to kill, poach, or trade turtles or their eggs, and they also punish offenders.</p>

        <h4>Interesting facts about turtles </h4><br>
        <ol>
            <li>All seven species are considered threatened or endangered-Two are critically endangered (hawksbill and Kemp's ridley), one is endangered green and and three are threatened (leatherback, olive ridley, and loggerhead). </li><br>
            <li>It is estimated that only one out of 1,000 hatchlings survives to be an adult. They have many natural predators including birds, crabs, fish, and mammals like racoons.</li><br>
            <li>Some sea turtles migrate very long distances while others stay close to home. Leatherbacks and loggerheads can travel thousands of miles each year, while greens and olive ridleys have shorter migrations, while hawksbills rarely leave a relatively small area.</li><br>
            <li>The sex of sea turtles, like other reptiles, depends on the temperature in the nest. That temperature is generally around 82 degrees F (29 degrees C) though that can vary by species and location.</li><br>
