        <p>The Bentota Turtle Hatchery Project is a popular attraction in Bentota for all travellers. The pristine golden shores that draws you to our island, also provides an enticing nesting ground for several endangered turtle species from the Olive Ridley to the Leatherback turtle. The project aims at conserving and protecting the eggs from predators and other dangers. Visit the turtle hatchery in Bentota to learn about these endangered graceful creatures of the sea.
        At sunset, you can witness the baby turtles being set free on the beach and watch them make their way back to the ocean. Visitors are asked to be mindful of the process of returning baby turtles to the sea. Loud noises are not allowed, nor are bright lights and flash photography; the baby turtles can confuse the lights for the moon over the ocean, which hinders them from being able to return home.

        <h4>Sajev Lucksman</h4>
        <p>A place that has a reputation for the conservation of turtles. The person who showed us around was obviously very enthusiastic about the work being done and passionate about the damage being done to turtles by fishing nets and plastic. The maimed turtles being cared for is a lesson to learn from. I suggest a visit just to show how as humans we impact on the lives of other animals.
            The project conserves all possible species of turtles but majorly the Green and Olive Ridley turtles were present during our visit. We were blessed to see the hatching of eggs .

            <h4>Ashan Rider</h4>
            <p>Sea turtles are no newcomers to the party, since they made their grand entrance at least 100 million years ago. Sadly, a majority of the species, including the Leatherback, the Hawksbill, and the Kemp's Ridley, are endangered as a result of pollution, climate change, and overfishing.
                You may have visions of watching thousands of baby sea turtles scurrying to towards their new ocean home as you cheer them on, but this is just one of many rewarding aspects of a turtle conservation program. Daily tasks also include work related to attending to the care of the eggs, counting them, helping build a hatchery, relocating them to a local hatchery to be incubated, and helping out with general tasks within the hatchery itself.

                <h4>David Ashton</h4>
                <p>Sea Turtle Project does a great service by giving shelter to turtle eggs and taking caring of them until they hatch. Also they give shelter to injured sea turtles as they can’t survive in the ocean alone. Pay a visit if you are in the area. You can learn a lot about these beautiful creatures. The staff here is very friendly and supportive and ready to answer your questions about sea turtles.
